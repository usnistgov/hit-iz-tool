<li>The Tester configures the NIST Test Tool with the appropriate Username, Password, FacilityID, and Endpoint information.  Note that the values for these parameters must be chosen to be those appropriate to the System Under Test (IIS). </li>
<li>The Tester causes the NIST Test Tool to electronically generate and transmit to the System Under Test a SOAP connectivity request message submitSingleMessage that conforms to the SOAP 1.2 standard and CDC WSDL 1.0 used for transporting an HL7 request message to an IIS  </li>
<li>The System Under Test electronically generates and transmits to the EHR-S Test Agent in the NIST Test Tool a SOAP connectivity response message submitSingleMessageResponse that conforms to the SOAP 1.2 standard and CDC WSDL 1.0 and that is used for transporting an HL7 response message to a sender (initiator) system </li>
<li>The Test Tool validates the SOAP connectivity response message for conformance to the SOAP 1.2 standard and CDC WSDL 1.0  </li>
<li>The Test Tool generates a Validation Report listing the results of the validation </li>
<li>The Tester reviews the Validation Report and compares the results to the Objectives and Evaluation Criteria associated with the Receiver SOAPCON_2_SubmitSingleMessage_Response Test Case  </li>
