<li>The Tester configures the NIST Test Tool with Username, Password, FacilityID, and Endpoint information</li>
<li>The Tester causes the NIST Test Tool to electronically generate and transmit to the System Under Test a SOAP connectivity request message submitSingleMessage that conforms to the SOAP 1.2 standard and CDC WSDL 1.0 with the exception that the hl7Message element contains two HL7 messages, rather than one message as required by the CDC specification</li>
<li>The System Under Test electronically generates and transmits to the EHR-S Test Agent in the NIST Test Tool a SOAP response message MessageTooLargeFault that conforms to the SOAP 1.2 standard and CDC WSDL 1.0 and that is used for transporting an appropriate HL7 fault response message to a sender (initiator) system</li>
<li>The Test Tool validates the SOAP response message for conformance to the SOAP 1.2 standard and CDC WSDL 1.0 </li>
<li>The Test Tool generates a Validation Report listing the results of the validation</li>
<li>The Tester reviews the Validation Report and compares the results to the Objectives and Evaluation Criteria associated with the Receiver SOAPCON_4_FaultDetection-Generation_MessageSizeFault Test Case </li>
