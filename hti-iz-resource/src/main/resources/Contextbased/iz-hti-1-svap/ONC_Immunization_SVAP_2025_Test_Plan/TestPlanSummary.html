<h2>Test Case Group: Administration Group</h2>
<h3>Description</h3>null<br/><h3>Test Objectives</h3>null<br/>
The administration group is design to test: (1) the creation of a broad scope of immunization messages including support for new and historical administrations, refusals, combination vaccines, patient consent and various observations including VIS and VFC. (2) the receipt and handling of various acknowledgement messages including application accept, application error, and application warning. Test Cases consists of 2 steps: (1) creating immunization messages based on the Immunization Messaging Standard (Z22 Profile-VXU Message) and specific Test Data, and (2) receiving acknowledgment messages based on the Immunization Messaging Standard (Z23 Profile-ACK Message).

A clinic staff member collects basic patient demographic information including name, date of birth and sex. A clinic provider, Wilma Thomas (physician ID 654) reviews the patient&#39;s vaccination history and determines that the child previously received Hepatitis B vaccine 1 day after birth and 1 month after birth. The staff member determines that the patient needs DTaP, Hib, IPV, Rotavirus and Pneumococcal vaccinations. Because of the patient&#39;s status of Native American, he qualifies for all Vaccine For Children (VFC) supplied vaccines under the status of VFC eligible - American Indian/Alaska Native. The parents are given 5 Vaccine Information Sheets (VIS) to review. After reading them, they agree that the child should receive all the vaccinations recommended. They also agree that the data should be shared once it is incorporated into the local IIS. They indicate that reminders and recalls may be sent by any method. Appropriate doses of DTaP/Hib/IPV (Pentacel), Rotavirus (RotaTeq) and Pneumococcal (Prevnar 13) are selected from the clinic&#39;s stock of publically funded vaccines. A clinician, Lily Jackson (ID 7824) prepares and administers the doses to the patient and then enters the data into the EHR and transmits it to the IIS.</p><br/><h3>Test Objectives</h3><p>Create an administration message containing historical (using CVX) and new administrations (using NDC)</p><p>Support for next of kin</p><p>Support for patient consent</p><p>Support for VIS</p><p>Support for funding source</p><p>Support for VFC data.</p><br/></td>
