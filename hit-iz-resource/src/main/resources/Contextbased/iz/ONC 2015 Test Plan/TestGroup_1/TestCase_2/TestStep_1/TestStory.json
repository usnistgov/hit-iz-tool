  "teststorydesc" : "A 32 year old female, Elise Wong, visits a clinic for a well woman visit. A clinic staff member collects basic patient demographic information including name, date of birth and sex. A clinic provider, Wilma Thomas (physician ID 654) reviews the patient's vaccination history and determines that Elise has received her influenza vaccinations on 10/12/2014 and 11/12/2013, but is in need of a tetanus booster. Because of the patient's age she does not qualify for Vaccine For Children (VFC) supplied vaccine. Elise is given the appropriate Vaccine Information Sheet (VIS) to review. After reading it, she agrees to receive the recommended vaccination. She also agrees that the data should be shared once it is incorporated into the local IIS. She indicates that reminders and recalls may be sent by any method. An appropriate dose of Td (TENIVAC) is selected from the clinic's stock of privately funded vaccines. A clinician, Lily Jackson (ID 7824) prepares and administers the doses to the patient and then enters the data into the EHR and transmits it to the IIS.",

For a given vaccine, one or more NDC\r\ncodes may be appropriate to message. For this reason, RXA-5.1 is categorized as\r\n\"Value - Test Case Fixed List\" and allows for multiple valid values. The\r\nMessage Content and Example Message data contain a single representative valid\r\nNDC code for example purposes.<o:p></o:p></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;\">ONC has determined that, from a regulatory/program perspective, an HIT Module cannot be required to be able to generate messages with the Vaccine Funding Source OBX segment for 2015 Edition certification testing.  For certification purposes, ONC permits Testers to ignore the error notification generated by the NIST Immunization Test Suite when this segment is missing.  Since the product under test will have to meet state reporting requirements when implemented, and many states require this information, it may be beneficial for HIT Modules to demonstrate support for the Vaccine Funding Source OBX segment during 2015 Edition certification testing. </p>"
