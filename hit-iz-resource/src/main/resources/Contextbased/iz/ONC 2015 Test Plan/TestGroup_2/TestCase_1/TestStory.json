  "teststorydesc" : "A male child patient, Cameron A. Fairchild, is brought to the clinic for an annual visit. A staff person locates his medical record in the EHR-S. The staff person confirms demographic information, including address. The staff person triggers a request to the IIS for an evaluated history and forecast for the child. The IIS performs a search for Cameron A. Fairchild and finds one high-confidence match. The IIS generates an evaluated history and forecast for Cameron and returns this to the EHR-S. One dose of vaccine was not administrated at the correct age and is marked as not valid. The EHR-S displays the evaluated history and forecast, including the not valid dose.",
