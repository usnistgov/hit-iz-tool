A clinic staff member collects basic patient demographic information including name, date of birth and sex. A clinic provider uses this information to locate the patient's medical record. The staff member then uses the medical record and system capabilities to query the IIS to request an evaluated history and forecast for the patient.",

It is important that the data is entered into the querying system as specified to enable linking the response message to the patient record.<br> <br>\r\nThe sending (querying) system will need to accept a response indicating that too many matches were found.",
