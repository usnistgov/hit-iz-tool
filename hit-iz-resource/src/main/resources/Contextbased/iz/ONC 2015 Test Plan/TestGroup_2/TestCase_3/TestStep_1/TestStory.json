  "teststorydesc" : "A female toddler, Donna Victoria Bee, is brought to the local clinic to determine what immunizations have been given and what immunizations are needed. A clinic staff member collects basic patient demographic information including name, date of birth, sex, and birth order (Donna was born 3rd in a triplet). A clinic provider uses this information to locate the patient's medical record. The staff member then uses the medical record and system capabilities to query the IIS to request an evaluated history and forecast for the patient.",
  "comments" : "Most of the test data is categorized as Test Case Fixed. It is important that the data is entered into the querying system as specified to enable linking the response message to the patient record.\r\n<br/>\r\nThe sending (querying) system will need to accept a response indicating that no matches were found.",
  "preCondition" : "Person exists in the system with the complete demographics as provided in the Test Data Specification.\r\n<br/>\r\nPerson has Medical Record Number (MR).\r\n<br/>\r\nPerson does not have a record in the IIS, even though complete demographics are used in the query.",

  "notes" : "If the HIT Module being tested is unable to control the Patient ID Number value that it creates (1) QPD-3.1 in the Query message can be populated with a different value than the one provided in the test data; (2) the Tester can ignore the associated error notification generated by the Tool; and (3) the Response message also must be modified accordingly.
