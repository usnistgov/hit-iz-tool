A response message is returned with a single immunization event and multiple immunization recommendations.\r\n<br/>\r\nAn adult male patient, Stanley S. Clement presents to the clinic, seeking an immunization for influenza. A clinic staff member locates his medical record in the electronic health record system. The staff member sees that he has previously had an immunization against influenza. The staff member triggers a request to the IIS to request an evaluated history and forecast for the patient. The IIS performs a search for Stanley S. Clement and finds one high confidence match. The IIS generates an evaluated history and forecast for Mr. Clement and returns this to the EHR-S. The EHR-S displays the evaluated history and forecast to the staff member.",
