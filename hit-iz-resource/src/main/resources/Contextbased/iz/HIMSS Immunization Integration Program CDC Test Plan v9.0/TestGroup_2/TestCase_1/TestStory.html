In order to match patients with those already in the immunization registry, the EHR or other clinical software should have the ability to record the mother&rsquo;s maiden name, whether the patient was part of a multiple birth, and if so, the order of birth (when such information is available).

The request includes the identifying information the immunization registry needs to match each patient with those in the registry including, if present, the mother&#39;s maiden name, a multiple birth indicator, and the birth order.

The EHR is able to display the evaluated immunization history received from the registry as well as the immunization history already present in the EHR so that a user can compare them. The EHR provides a way for the provider to view both histories, determine what is different (if anything), and update the existing EHR immunization history with new information from the public health registry if he or she chooses to do so.

When viewing such information, the provider can determine which immunizations were administered by the practice, which were entered manually as patient-reported, and which were accepted electronically from the public health registry.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>View Immunization Forecast:&nbsp;</strong>The system provides a view of the immunization forecast provided by the IIS.
