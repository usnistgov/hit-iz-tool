For example, twins living in the same household will have similar dates of birth, addresses, and may have similar names. The EHR or other clinical software system must be able to store information to successfully match with patients in immunization registries, if the information is available. Specific to immunization registries, that information includes the mother&#39;s maiden name, whether the patient was part of a multiple birth, and the birth order (i.e., ordinal number of birth, first, second, etc.). This information allows the provider to correctly identify the patient and also helps ensure a match when the EHR sends the patient&#39;s information to external systems such as an immunization registry.</p><p><strong>Provide Access to Update Immunization Information:&nbsp;</strong>The patient is able to add or request an update to immunization information for review by the provider.</p><p><strong>Review Patient-Provided Immunization Information:</strong> The EHR or other clinical software system provides a mechanism for the provider to review patient-generated immunization data. It also provides a mechanism for the provider to update or annotate the immunization history, indicating the source of the information.</p><p><strong>Request/Receive Patient Immunization Data and Identify Source:</strong> The EHR stores immunization history accepted electronically from other sources (such as a public health immunization registry consistent with HL7 version 2.5.1, Implementation Guide for Immunization Messaging Release 1.5) or communicated by the patient and manually entered by the clinician. When viewing such information, the provider can determine which immunizations were administered by the practice, which were entered manually as patient-reported, and which were accepted electronically from the public health registry.</p><p><strong>Data Quality Checks:&nbsp;</strong>Integrate additional data quality checks into IIP Testing and Recognition to improve data quality and reduce rejections.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Note: The EHR or other clinical software system prevents specific data issues which would potentially result in IIS errors as defined by the AIRA Error Codes.
