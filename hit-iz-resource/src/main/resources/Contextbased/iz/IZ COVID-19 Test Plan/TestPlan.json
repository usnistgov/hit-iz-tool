    "description": "This test plan is intended to be used for testing electronic immunization messages generated by HIT Modules for COVID-19 vaccinations. The test plan includes common use cases for reporting COVID-19 administrations (VXU Z22 Profile). A summary of the test plan is given below:\n1. Two-dose Vaccine Series with History of 1st Dose (e.g. Moderna vaccine)\u201d\n2.Two-dose Vaccine Series with no History of 1st Dose (e.g. Pfizer vaccine)\n3. Vaccine Refusal\n4. Single-dose Vaccine Series (e.g. Janssen (Johnson & Johnson) vaccine)\nAlong with the test cases, the test plan includes example messages for each test case. \n\nThe test plan provides scenario-based test cases and test steps to test messages for conformance to the Z22 profile (Send Immunization Record) as described in the HL7 2.5.1 Immunization Implementation Guide Release 1.5 and associated Addendum as named in the ONC 2015 Edition HIT Certification Criterion ?170.315(f)(1) Transmission to immunization registries. The requirements for this test plan differ slightly from the ONC requirements in that codes from either the CVX code set or the NDC Directory are required for vaccines in new vaccine administered records. The ONC certification requirement mandates an NDC code or both an NDC code and a CVX code. Although an NDC code or a CVX code can be sent for COVID-19 vaccine reporting, best practice is to send both.\n\nAcknowledgment messages returned by the IIS are out of scope for this Test Plan.",
