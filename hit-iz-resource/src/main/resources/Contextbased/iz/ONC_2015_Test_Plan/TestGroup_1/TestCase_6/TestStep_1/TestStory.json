For a given vaccine, one or more NDC codes may be appropriate to message. For this reason, RXA-5.1 is categorized as \"Value - Test Case Fixed List\" and allows for multiple valid values. The Message Content and Example Message data contain a single representative valid NDC code for example purposes. </div><div>ONC has determined that, from a regulatory/program perspective, an HIT Module cannot be required to be able to generate messages with the Vaccine Funding Source OBX segment for 2015 Edition certification testing. For certification purposes, ONC permits Testers to ignore the error notification generated by the NIST Immunization Test Suite when this segment is missing. Since the product under test will have to meet state reporting requirements when implemented, and many states require this information, it may be beneficial for HIT Modules to demonstrate support for the Vaccine Funding Source OBX segment during 2015 Edition certification testing. </div>"
